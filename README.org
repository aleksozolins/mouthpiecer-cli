#+title: mouthpiecer-cli

* About

*mouthpiecer-cli* is a Python based command line interface to a [[https://www.knack.com][Knack]] database.

The Mouthpiecer Knack front end can be found here: [[https://aleksozolins.knack.com/mouthpiecer#home/]]

- The app is meant for individual users to manage their French Horn mouthpiece collection (really).
- Users can also view the collections of other "mouthpiecers" and can arrange mouthpiece trades as well.
- For now, some features have been removed from the front end and will be re-introduced as the cli develops.

Ultimately, the cli should exactly mirror the feature-set of the web front end.

* Dependencies

For now, any dependencies have to be install manually with =pip=.
